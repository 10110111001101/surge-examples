# World Simulation


Purpose: see if GeoClaw could handle a storm with the topography of world.


Topography was selected from NOAA Grid Extract. 12 topography files from -180 to 180 were extracted and later adjusted to be from 0 to 360. Longitude of topography files was from -60 to 60.


Ran multiple storms using the topography of the entire world.


Storms we ran so far were near Australia and New Zealand.


Created a script that automatically placed gauges near the storm.
